Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts used to convert raw multiple-choice question files into a structured JSON database and then quiz yourself using a flashcard-style interface.

The workflow is:

- Parse Questions:
  _Note: a set of json formatting questions already provided for ECE 578_
  Place all your .txt question files in a folder
  
  Run the parser script to extract questions and correct answers

- Flash card quiz
  Run the flashcard script to study the questions interactively

Requirements:
- Python 3 10.0 or later
